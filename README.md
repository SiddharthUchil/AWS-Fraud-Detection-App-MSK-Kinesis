## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time fraud detection system using Amazon Web Services (AWS). It leverages AWS Managed Streaming for Kafka (MSK) and AWS Kinesis Data Analytics to process and analyze streaming data for potential fraudulent activities. The system uses a CloudFormation template to provision necessary AWS resources and configures them via the AWS Console. A Lambda function is employed to send data to a Kafka topic, which is then processed by Kinesis Data Analytics. Flagged transactions are subsequently stored in DynamoDB for further action.

## Kafka Topics and Data Flow
The real-time fraud detection system utilizes AWS Lambda functions, set up via a CloudFormation template, to generate and send sample banking transactions to Kafka topics within an AWS MSK cluster. The Kafka topics serve two main purposes:
- **Sample Transactions Topic**: This topic contains the stream of sample banking transactions generated by the Lambda function.
- **Flagged Transactions Topic**: This topic is dedicated to transactions that have been flagged as potentially fraudulent.

AWS Kinesis Data Analytics (KDA) with Apache Flink is employed as a sophisticated filter for the Kafka topics. It monitors the stream of sample transactions and applies fraud detection logic to identify suspicious activities. Once a transaction is flagged, it is published to the 'Flagged Transactions' topic within the same MSK cluster.

Subsequently, another Lambda function is triggered by the activity on the 'Flagged Transactions' topic. This function is responsible for capturing the details of the flagged transactions and storing them in a DynamoDB table for further analysis and action.

This setup ensures a seamless flow of data from transaction generation to fraud detection and storage, enabling efficient real-time monitoring and response to fraudulent activities.


## Architecture
The architecture of the real-time fraud detection system includes the following components:
- **AWS MSK**: Manages the Kafka clusters for handling streaming data.
- **AWS Kinesis Data Analytics**: Analyzes streaming data in real time.
- **AWS Lambda**: Executes code in response to triggers and sends data to Kafka topics.
- **AWS DynamoDB**: Stores flagged transactions identified as potentially fraudulent.
- **CloudFormation**: Automates the provisioning of the AWS resources.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying the fraud detection system, ensure you have the following:
- An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- AWS CLI installed and configured.
- Knowledge of working with AWS Console and CloudFormation templates.

## Deployment
### Step 1: CloudFormation Template
Use the provided CloudFormation template to create the necessary AWS resources. This includes the setup of MSK clusters, Kinesis Data Analytics applications, and DynamoDB tables.

### Step 2: AWS Console Configuration
After the resources are provisioned, configure them using the AWS Console to ensure they are set up according to the requirements of the fraud detection system.

### Step 3: Lambda Function
Deploy the Lambda function, which will be triggered to send data to the Kafka topic. Ensure that the function has the necessary permissions and configurations.

### Step 4: Data Processing
Once the data is sent to the Kafka topic, it is consumed by Kinesis Data Analytics for real-time analysis. The analytics application is designed to detect patterns and anomalies indicative of fraudulent transactions.

### Step 5: DynamoDB Storage
Transactions flagged as fraudulent by Kinesis Data Analytics are stored in a DynamoDB table. This allows for easy retrieval and further investigation.

## Usage
To use the fraud detection system, simply send transaction data to the Lambda function. The system will process and analyze the data in real time, flagging any transactions that appear to be fraudulent.
